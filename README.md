This is a project I am working on to understand the server side of application using

1. Nodejs
2. Expressjs

and other platforms which will be adding on as we go

Goals Achieved

# Docker
1. Was able to run a docker container for the application using the following command with debug mode from VScode IDE

```docker run -it --rm --name learning-node-js -v D:/Work/Expressjs/learning-node-js:/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app -p 40000:3000 -p 9229:9229 node```

2. To run the application using node have added start command in package.json and also edited launch.json for debugging in VSCode IDE

3. To run the application using nodemon use the following command

```docker exec -it learning-node-js npm start```

# Git

1. Learnt adding and using SSH key for work account and personal account

Will be adding soon!!!
